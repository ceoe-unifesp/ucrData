# `ucrData` R Package

## Overview

The `ucrData` package is designed to facilitate the download,
extraction, and parsing of Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) data
from the FBIâ€™s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. This package
streamlines the process of working with SHR datasets, offering functions
to retrieve specific years of data, manage file downloads, and load
fixed-width files into a tidy data format.

## Installation

To install the `ucrData` package, use the following command:

``` r
pak::pak("ceoe-unifesp/ucrData")
```

## Usage

### Main Functions

#### 1. Retrieve Available Years

The `shr_years()` function fetches the range of years for which SHR data
is available.

``` r
available_years <- shr_years()
print(available_years)
```

#### 2. Fetch Links to SHR Data

Use `shr_links()` to retrieve download links for the desired years.

``` r
links <- shr_links(years = 2010:2020)
print(links)
```

#### 3. Download and Extract SHR Data

The `read_shr_online()` function automates the process of downloading,
extracting, and reading SHR data for the specified years.

``` r
shr_data <- read_shr_online(years = 2010:2020, verbose = TRUE)
head(shr_data)
```

### Custom Steps

For more control, the following lower-level functions can be used:

- **Download Files:** `shr_download(link_data, path)`  
  Downloads SHR files from a given list of links.

- **Unzip Files:** `shr_unzip(zip_file, path)`  
  Extracts and renames files within ZIP archives.

- **Read SHR Data:** `shr_read(file)`  
  Reads and parses a single SHR file into a tidy data frame.

### Specifications and Structure

The package includes predefined fixed-width format specifications
(`shr_fwf_specs()`) and column types (`shr_col_types()`), ensuring
consistent parsing of SHR data. These helpers are invoked internally by
`shr_read()`.

### Example Workflow

``` r
library(ucrData)

# Step 1: Get available years
years <- shr_years()

# Step 2: Download and parse data
shr_data <- read_shr_online(years = years[1:5], verbose = TRUE)

# Step 3: Inspect the data
print(head(shr_data))
```

## Notes

- The data is downloaded from the UCR website and may require internet
  access during the process.
- Temporary files are cleaned up after data processing, unless specified
  otherwise.
